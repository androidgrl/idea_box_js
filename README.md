#Revenge of Idea Box

Every developer has more ideas than time. As David Allen likes to say "the human brain is for creating ideas, not remembering them." In this project, we'll be building a simple application for recording and archiving our ideas (good and bad alike).

Throughout the project, one of our focuses will be on providing a fluid and responsive client-side interface. To this end, we'll rely on javascript and Jquery to implement snappy filtering in the browser, and AJAX to enable inconspicuous communication between client and server.
